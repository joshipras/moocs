    "\n",
    "1. User consistency: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - If user_id used, users gets consistent experience across devices as long as they are signed in.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - If testing a change that crosses the sign-in, sign-out border then user-ID doesn't work well.(eg. page layout, location of sign in bar) use cookie instead to get consistency across sign-in sign-out border but not across devices.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - User visibility is one consideration to decide whether user_id or cookie is suitable. Other consideration is what you need to measure.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - To measure learning effect, whether users adapting to change or latency change,  need stateful metric like user_id or cookie.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - if data is identified, security and confidentiality questions must be answered\n",
    "    - Informed consent needed if user identifiable.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Variability:\n",
    "    - Unit of analysis is the denominbator of your metric. Eg. CTR = Clicks/Pageviews. Pageviews is the unit of analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If unit of diversion is also a pageview, analytical variability likely close to empirical variability.\n",

    "- Measuring variability analytically makes an assumption about \n",

    "    - cannot identify which users will be affected by change\n",
    "    - not sure it change works so need to target global population\n",
    "    - not a consideration if the change affects 90% of traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Before launching:\n",
    "    - Double check with Engineering team about the browsers etc the change affects\n",
    "    - Ensure the test does not interfere with other currently run tests\n",
    "    - same filters on targeted and un-targeted populations\n",
